354,inhibition,intriguingly  we demonstrated that m mdsc could be readily induced by ascitic fluids \( af \) from oc patients  which was predominantly dependent on il 6  il 10 and stat3 activation as neutralization of il 6 and or il 10 or inhibition of stat3 abrogated mdsc 's expansion while recombinant il 6 and il 10 recapitulated the expansive effect of af furthermore  predominantly elevated levels of il 6 and il 10 has been noted in the af which was positively correlated with the abundance of m mdsc as well as poor prognosis of oc patients
355,induced,as expected  we observed that af driven stat3 activation upregulated the expression of arginase \( arg1 \) and inducible nitric oxide synthase \( inos \) in induced m mdsc through which these mdsc executed the immunosuppressive activity
356,activation,remarkably  hvem silenced ovarian cancer cells \( primary ovarian cancer cells and ovcar3 \) increased the number of t cells and the secretion of tumor necrosis factor \( tnf \) and interferon \( ifn \)  while activated t cells promoted the apoptosis of hvem silenced ovarian cancer cells
357,regulated,rac gtpase activating protein 1 \( racgap1 \) can regulate cytokinesis and cell differentiation
358,regulated,cellular studies showed that racgap1 can positively regulate the activation of rhoa and erk proteins
359,induced,this study is the first to report that the combination of rgo ag and tsa can cause potential cytotoxicity and also induce significantly greater cell death compared to either rgo ag alone or tsa alone in skov3 cells by various mechanisms including reactive oxygen species generation  mitochondrial dysfunction  and dna damage
360,inhibition,parp inhibitor efficacy on poly \( adp ribose \) polymer \( par \) formation in vivo can be quantified by pharmacodynamic assays that measure par activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells \( pbmc \)
361,inhibition,we have previously shown that inhibition of histone deacetylase \( hdac \) activity induces expression of the pro inflammatory and pro angiogenic chemokine interleukin 8 \( cxcl8  il 8 \) in oc cells  resulting in their increased survival and proliferation
362,induced,we have previously shown that inhibition of histone deacetylase \( hdac \) activity induces expression of the pro inflammatory and pro angiogenic chemokine interleukin 8 \( cxcl8  il 8 \) in oc cells  resulting in their increased survival and proliferation
363,induced,the induced cxcl8 expression in oc cells is dependent on histone acetyltransferase \( hat \) activity of creb binding protein \( cbp \)  but not p300  and is associated with hat dependent p65 recruitment to cxcl8 promoter
364,induced,together  our results show that the cxcl8 expression in oc cells is induced by combined inhibition of hdac1  2  and 3  and silenced by suppression of hat activity of cbp
365,inhibition,together  our results show that the cxcl8 expression in oc cells is induced by combined inhibition of hdac1  2  and 3  and silenced by suppression of hat activity of cbp
366,inhibition,these findings strongly suggest that physapubescin b has potential antitumor activity and may circumvent taxol resistance in human ovarian cancer cells through inhibition of aberrant activation of stat3
367,inhibition,these results demonstrate that the synergistic effect on growth inhibition observed in the combination between rucaparib and nutlin 3 rg7388 is not the result of increased p53 molecular pathway activation
368,inhibition,exendin 4 inhibited migration and promoted apoptosis through caspase 3 7 activation
369,inhibition,additionally  incretin treatment inhibited activation of apoptosis in tnf stimulated endothelial cells
370,induced,baicalin  an active flavone isolated from scutellaria baicalensis georgi  has been demonstrated to induce various beneficial biochemical effects such as anti inflammatory  anti viral  and antitumor effects
371,inhibition,enzyme inhibition assays in a cell free system showed that tsa was the most potent inhibitor of total hdac enzyme activity followed by pxd 101 and ms 275
372,inhibition,enzyme inhibition assays in a cell free system showed that tsa was the most potent inhibitor of total hdac enzyme activity followed by pxd 101 and ms 275
373,activation,insulin treatment of the human granulosa like tumor cell line \( kgn \) resulted in decreased downregulated expression of mir 27a 3p  and this effect appeared to be mediated by signal transducer and activator of transcription stat1 and stat3
374,induced,the aunps were associated with a temporary reduction in metabolic activity  but metabolic activity remained more than 60 for all sample types nps significantly affected the cell proliferation activity in first 12 h the increase in nanoparticle size and concentration induced the production of reactive oxygen species in 24 h
